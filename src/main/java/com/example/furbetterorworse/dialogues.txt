Rizzly
*Slowly sits down*

Crazy how the whole city’s out there, and somehow the best view’s sitting across from me.

Lucky you, pasta, candlelight, skyline views... All handcrafted exclusively, by yours truly.

So… How’s the food? Tell me it’s amazing. Or lie. Either way, I’ll take it.

*Smirks*

Haha! You’re trying really hard to act unaffected. It’s cute. Keep going, let’s see how long you’ll last.

Interruption
(You and Unc sit in silence, sharing wine and moonlight. No words. Just presence.)

Ayo, this is what I missed out on?

Air pollution? Alcohol? Those are what impresses you these days?

If you change your mind… I’ve got a rooftop, two forks, and the world’s best spaghetti waiting for you.

(He tosses a folded napkin onto the table — scrawled with a doodle of a heart and a raccoon — then turns to leave.)


Pookie
I figured something simple would be nice. Just us…, nothing too competitive.

Okay… I think everything’s set!

(A few minutes later)

*Looks down and blushes*

I, uh… didn’t think you would want to hang out with someone like me.

But I’m really glad you did.

Interruption
Hi, uh… Sorry, I really didn't mean to interrupt.

But… I’ve been thinking about you. A lot.

I know this is really bad timing, but… can you come with me? Just for a few minutes?

(You follow him unconsciously as you get melted away by his cuteness)


Unc
You’ve had coffee dates. You’ve had rooftop dinners. Let’s try something… a little harder to forget.

*Pauses*

Have you ever noticed how small everything looks from up here?

The people, the buildings, the noise. All of it fades.

Interruption
*Loud helicopter whirring in the distance*

(You both look up as a blinding spotlight cuts through the night.)

(Within a flash, a shiny black helicopter lands on the rooftop in a flash.
You watch in shock as a composed, dangerous figure emerges from the shadows.)

(It was Unc.)

(To Rizzly) Apologies for the interruption. You’ve had your fun.

*Turns towards you.*

Hop on. Private jet. Midnight cityview. You deserve better than overcooked noodles.

(Before you can even react, Unc is already turning away,
striding back toward the helicopter with the same cold confidence he arrived with.)

(As if your decision had already been made, and he was just here to inform you.)
